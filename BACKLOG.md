## Block 296–300 | Billing Automation & Triggers | route: /automation/billing

1. Create rule builder to define billing automation rules (if condition → then create/send bill)
2. Add support for order-based conditions (e.g., total > 1,000 or has coupon)
3. Add time-based scheduling (e.g., auto-generate bills every 9am)
4. Trigger webhook/LINE when bill is auto-created (mock only)
5. Add automation log UI with timestamp, status, rule name

Status: planned
